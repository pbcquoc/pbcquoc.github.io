I'm Quoc and this is my blog where my journey is told. Mostly, i will share my thought about the technology fascinated me. 
* I try to visualize and explain the fundamental concepts, models: MSE, Cross Entropy, KL Deverency, Convolution Nets, Long-Short Term Memory, Attention Mechanism and give a clear picture about how it works.
* I love to contribute to Viet Nam open source, and help self-leaners have the awesome documents.
